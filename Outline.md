I want to create an opensource file sharing application 

what problem I want to solve is I have a file on my phone and I want to share it with my friend on a laptop 

so it will need to make the file available on the network and then the friend can download it from the network 

can you help me with this

im thinking it should be a web application so we can use fastapi and jinja we dont want to save any data we just want to share the file from the users storage 

📌 Problem Statement
Allow a user (on phone or desktop) to serve a file temporarily on their local network, and share a link with another device (on same network) to download the file — without saving the file on any backend or database.

🔧 Functional Requirements
User selects a file to share.

Server generates a unique download link.

Other users can use the link to download the file.

File is not saved on disk — just streamed.

All communication stays within local network.

📍 Roadmap
🟢 Phase 1: MVP — Single User, One File
✅ Build a FastAPI server with:

/ route: File upload form

/upload: Accepts file upload, generates a random token

/download/{token}: Streams file directly to client

✅ Use in-memory storage (e.g., Python dict) to map token -> file

✅ Provide download link after upload

🟡 Phase 2: Multi-User Support
🔄 Problem: How to handle multiple users sharing multiple files concurrently?
Solution:

Use token-based isolation (e.g., uuid4() for each upload).

Store each file upload as:

python
Copy
Edit
files[token] = {
    "owner_ip": request.client.host,
    "filename": ...,
    "content": ...,
    "type": ...,
    "expires_at": datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=10)
}
Users will only be able to access their file by knowing the token.

🔐 Access Control (Optional):
Add logic to restrict download to same IP range, or just same network.

Optional PIN/password per file (if needed later).

🟠 Phase 3: File Expiry / Cleanup
Problem: RAM will fill up if old files stay forever.

Solution:

Add expires_at timestamp per file.

Write a background task to clean expired files every X minutes.

python
Copy
Edit
@app.on_event("startup")
async def start_cleanup():
    async def cleaner():
        while True:
            now = datetime.utcnow()
            for token in list(files):
                if files[token]["expires_at"] < now:
                    del files[token]
            await asyncio.sleep(60)

    asyncio.create_task(cleaner())
🔵 Phase 4: UI Improvements
Make UI mobile-first

Add QR code for download link (use qrcode Python lib or JS)

Show progress bar for upload/download

Add drag & drop support

🟣 Phase 5: Offline Bundle / Zero-Install
Package as a single .py file for desktop use (run with Python and open browser)

Use PWA service worker to optionally cache frontend offline

🔴 Future Considerations
Issue	Possible Solution
🌍 Only works on same Wi-Fi	Expected. Use local IPs, not localhost.
💾 RAM limits	Stream uploads directly instead of reading into memory
🔐 Security	Tokenized download URLs, optional short-term passwords
🌐 NAT or different subnets	Won’t work unless port-forwarded (out of scope)
🛑 Session collision	Tokens are random enough to avoid conflict
⚠️ Upload abuse	Since no internet access — minimal concern

[Phone/Desktop] --UPLOAD--> [FastAPI Server (RAM)]
                                 |
                            Generates token
                                 |
               [Friend Device] --DOWNLOAD via IP/token-->
✅ Summary Action Plan
Step	Task
✅	Set up FastAPI with upload + download routes
✅	Use in-memory dict with token-based file mapping
✅	Serve local IP to users (not localhost)
🔜	Add background job to auto-delete old files
🔜	Improve UI (mobile first, QR code, etc.)
🔜	Package into standalone script or optional Docker image
